# MATLAB
This is my Undergraduate research project of bi-modal neural networks implementation with MATLAB

Bimodal_Double_Layered Neural Networks is the implementation of bi-modal neural network based on CANN and Hebbian Rule for numerical simulation.

Josephson Junction simulation on Neuron is the re-implementation of "Josephson junction simulation of neurons",	arXiv:1002.2892 . 

MT-ME-Balance-204-Data-Logger is the data logging software for MT-ME-Balance-204 coding with MATLAB.

Travelling Salesman Problem is my undergraduate project for Travelling Salesman Problem. 
It based on Monte Carlo methon to generae random cities combination and estimate the energy with their total travel distance.
And I use the genetic algorithm to switch cities combination with certain transision probability.
